# GM Info Plugin

This unofficial TaleSpire plugin for adding text to minis and converted-props which only the GM can see.
Can be used on player visible props like chests to provide GM only information about the player visible properly
or on props that are hidden to provide the GM with notes (visible all the time).

### Typical Scenario 1: Use With Player Visible Items

In this scenario the GM has a player visible prop like a chest and want to note down the contents of the chest.
The GM can add a GM Info note to the chest which will be visible to the GM only but not to the players.

### Typical Scenario 2: Use With Player Invisible Items

In this sceanrio the GM wants to leave some notes for himself but they are not assocaited with any particular
visible prop. In such a case the GM can add a prop or mini, and a GM Info note to the prop or mini and then
hide it. In such a case the players will not see either the prop or mini used for the note nor the note itself.
Please note that in this scenario the note will be visible to the GM at all times.
